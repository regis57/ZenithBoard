# Changelog

## 0.2.0
- New wall layout (16:10): airline logo or aircraft-class silhouette top-right, LED-style Planespotters photo bottom-right, airline name line, distance/direction footer.
- Colour setting: `zenithboard color amber|green|red|white` (amber default), menu entry, per-tablet override.
- Logo library: `zenithboard logo add|fetch|remove|list`, `zenithboard data update` (airline names). No real airline logos are bundled.
- Photos are fetched by the Pi (proxy) and enabled by default for new installs; demo uses fictional airlines/logos and mock illustrations.
- Demo runs on port 8081 so it cannot clash with the real wall; README documents the ports and the ADSB Exchange local map.
- Detects low-memory (< 1.5 GB) and older Pi boards: one-time notice, ACARS marked "not recommended", warning for many feeders, memory in `zenithboard status`.
- README: "Which Raspberry Pi?" table.

## 0.1.0
- Licence changed to GPL-3.0-or-later.
- New installer menu: 1 ADSB, 2 FlightInfo, 3 ACARS, plus Settings / Status / Uninstall.
- readsb (recommended) or dump1090-fa; ADSB Exchange mandatory; FlightAware, Flightradar24, Plane Finder optional; single MLAT enforced.
- First-run questions: metric/imperial, antenna position, radius. `zenithboard` command to change them later.
- FlightInfo rewritten: dependency-free Python server, canvas dot-matrix wall with built-in 5x7 font (works offline), radius presets, units, themes, auto-cycling, self-refresh.
- ACARS: acarsdec -> filtered SQLite with 7-day rolling retention -> Grafana dashboard.
- Tests and CI.
- `zenithboard update`: one command to upgrade ZenithBoard and every installed component.
- `zenithboard location`: sets the antenna position everywhere it is stored and lists what must be changed manually.

## 0.0.1
- Initial prototype.
