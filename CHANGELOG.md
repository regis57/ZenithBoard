# Changelog

## 0.2.1
- The animated sky is now one continuous day: the sun and the moon travel along an arc, the colours are interpolated from the clock (dawn, midday, dusk), clouds are lit from the sun's side, high cirrus drifts past, haze sits on the horizon, and the stars fade in and twinkle at night.
- `zenithboard photos on|off` now restarts the wall, so the setting takes effect immediately (before, it was written to the configuration and ignored until the next restart).
- New `zenithboard photos test [HEX]`: checks from the Pi that Planespotters can be reached and that an image downloads, without waiting for an aircraft.
- `REAL_PHOTOS=1 ./bin/zenithboard-demo` fetches the real photos of the demo's two real airliners, so photos can be seen before the antenna is connected.
- `zenithboard status` now shows whether photos are on, and prints the local map address that is actually installed (`/tar1090/` from readsb, or `/adsbx/`) instead of always `/adsbx/`.
- Fixed "Aircraft list: not downloaded" in `zenithboard status` when run without `sudo`: `/var/lib/zenithboard` was not traversable by other users. `zenithboard update` repairs existing installs.

## 0.2.0
- New wall layout (16:10): aircraft silhouette top-right, a real Planespotters photo (with credit and link) bottom-right, airline name line, distance/direction footer.
- Silhouettes now match the real aircraft model: 15 kinds (single-aisle, wide-body, 747 hump, A380 double deck, rear-engined jets, turboprops, bizjets, light/twin piston, helicopters incl. Chinook and tilt-rotor, fighters, delta-wings, transports, bombers, gliders, balloons), including military types. Type table checked against the ICAO type list.
- No photo? The corner shows an animated sky (drifting clouds, day/dusk/night, turning propellers and rotors) with a side view of the matching model and its name.
- Airline logos removed entirely (no logo library, no `logo` command, no `SHOW_LOGOS`).
- `zenithboard update` now resynchronises its download folder when the GitHub history was rewritten (e.g. commits re-signed) instead of failing with "Diverging branches"; it says clearly when the code could not be updated and which version you stay on.
- `zenithboard update` no longer leaves root-owned files in your download folder (which made your own `git fetch` fail with "Permission denied").
- Fixed the ADSB Exchange update URL (`feed-update.sh`).
- Optional monthly refresh of the aircraft model list (tar1090-db, downloaded to the Pi only): `zenithboard data update|auto on|off|status`, settings menu toggle, systemd timer.
- Colour setting: `zenithboard color amber|green|red|white` (amber default), menu entry, per-tablet override.
- Photos are fetched by the Pi (proxy) and enabled by default for new installs. Demo has mock photos for some aircraft only, so both states show.
- Demo runs on port 8081 so it cannot clash with the real wall; README documents the ports and the ADSB Exchange local map.
- Detects low-memory (< 1.5 GB) and older Pi boards: one-time notice, ACARS marked "not recommended", warning for many feeders, memory in `zenithboard status`.
- README: "Which Raspberry Pi?" table.

## 0.1.0
- Licence changed to GPL-3.0-or-later.
- New installer menu: 1 ADSB, 2 FlightInfo, 3 ACARS, plus Settings / Status / Uninstall.
- readsb (recommended) or dump1090-fa; ADSB Exchange mandatory; FlightAware, Flightradar24, Plane Finder optional; single MLAT enforced.
- First-run questions: metric/imperial, antenna position, radius. `zenithboard` command to change them later.
- FlightInfo rewritten: dependency-free Python server, canvas dot-matrix wall with built-in 5x7 font (works offline), radius presets, units, themes, auto-cycling, self-refresh.
- ACARS: acarsdec -> filtered SQLite with 7-day rolling retention -> Grafana dashboard.
- Tests and CI.
- `zenithboard update`: one command to upgrade ZenithBoard and every installed component.
- `zenithboard location`: sets the antenna position everywhere it is stored and lists what must be changed manually.

## 0.0.1
- Initial prototype.
